# Fire Detection System

This repository contains a comprehensive fire detection system with three key functionalities: image fire detection, video fire detection, and real-time fire detection. The system uses a pre-trained model to detect fire in different media formats and can be run locally via Streamlit for easy access and interaction.

## Key Features

1. **Image Fire Detection**: Detect fire in static images. The system processes individual images and returns whether a fire is detected or not.
2. **Video Fire Detection**: Detect fire in video files. The system processes each frame of the video to identify the presence of fire.
3. **Real-Time Fire Detection**: This feature allows detection of fire in real-time video streams, such as from webcams or security cameras.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your machine.
   
2. **Virtual Environment**: It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### Steps to Run the Application

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   In your project directory, run the following command to create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   Now, use Streamlit to run the main application:

   ```bash
   streamlit run run.py
   ```

This will open the web interface in your browser, where you can test the system's fire detection features for images, videos, and real-time streams.

### Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:

```bash
deactivate
```

### Dataset Structure

The `dataset` directory contains the training, testing, and validation datasets for the fire detection model. Each dataset folder (`train`, `test`, and `valid`) contains subdirectories for images and corresponding labels. The dataset configuration is defined in `data.yaml`.
